- Improve internal design of ewterm

- Its code is from large part very big mess - exch.c/ewterm.c has no clear
  centralized exchange protocol handler, state keeping is very ugly and
  protocol communication is done in multiple functions. Someone should clean
  (hm, rewrite :) that, possibly someone from Siemens who *knows* the
  protocol).

- The forms should be fully integrated to ewterm, not just connected by thin
  lines of help.c.

- Ewterm<->ewrecv protocol should be exchange-independent as much as possible.

- Splitting of mlog files.

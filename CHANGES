Changes in mdterm (by Michal Kara).

V 1.0

--- 20-Aug-1996 ---

- Vim-compatibile mode added to mdsfld. Now, when no file specified,
  it reads stdin, sends it to tmp file and to stdout. 

- Port ID name changed to include login name to avoid possible conflicts.
  Now the name format is "mdportid.$(USER)".

- CR is not converted to LF while sending chars to serial/connection.

- Config format changed. Now lines are in the form "NAME=VALUE". It
  is mostly to ease options backward compatibility.

- Some changes in program (move of blocks) to fix problems with dirs.

- When user changes speed/device, a warning is printed, that the change
  will not take place immediately.

- When device is changed from serial to net, port number is reset to 23.

- Error is printed when program could not save phonebook and preferences.

V 1.1

--- 23-Aug-96 ---

- CUA window is directly refreshed when you exit from scrollback.
  So all changes all immediately visible.

- When sending file and LF is read, command buffer is cleared. This
  allows having ! Text ! comments after commands in the file.

- Auto LogOn when command sent option added

- Fixed some bugs in parsing arguments

V 1.2

--- 28-Aug-96 ---

- Fixed bug in getting message port number. When two MDTERMs were
  running, they were using same port ID.

V 1.3

--- 01-Sep-96 ---

- Tree changed, all files that will be put in $(LIBDIR)/mdterm are now
  in the 'lib' directory.

- When mdterm finds lock on device it wants to use, it looks whether the
  process that created the lock still exists. If not, asks user to
  confirm that found lock is obsolette and should be removed.

- Possibility of defining lock directory. When it is commented out,
  locks are not used.

- Makefile changed and InstallScript added to be able to properly install
  mdterm. LOCKDIR can be specified in Makefile.

- Mode function removed form options menu since it cannot work here anumore.

- mdterm.guide finished.

V 1.4

--- 05-Sep-96 ---

- Serial transfer fastened. Data are transmitted by blocks whenever possible.
  Screen is not refreshed when there are more characters to be received.

- Strange things do not happen anymore when binary data are received

V 1.5

--- 13-Sep-96 ---

- PgUp and PgDown placed on CTRL-keys.

- Check for CD signal added. When program gets prompt, it checks if CD signal is
  active. If yes, it checks for it every time it sends command. When CD is not
  detected during sending command, connection is probably lost and program
  switches itself to logged-off mode.

- Command editting allowed also when program is in line (buffered) mode and
  scrollback is shown. When ENTER is pressed, scrollback disappears and ENTER
  key is passed on, so command is executed.

- In DialList and FileList, you can type characters and active entry in the
  listview will move to the entry you typed.

- PID is also stored with port ID in mdportid.$USER file. User is asked if
  mdterm should overwrite this file and it is removed on quit. MDSFl also
  checks for existatnce of process that created portid file. 

V 1.6

--- 19-Sep-96 ---

- "Mode" relabeled to Raw/Buf

- History-storing routine now allocates more memory. It might fix
  bug with trashed scrollback...

- Quitting is done slightly other way; the old one cause curses to crash
  on their cleanup (why???).

- Colors added.

- Port is now freed when program is invoked with bad option.

- Option to switch to line (buffered) mode on LogOn added.

- Possibility to switch between two history modes added.

V 1.7

--- 24-Sep-96 ---

- Bug when editting phonebook fixed

- No longer crashes when you have empty list and want to search by keys.

- In "Keep" history mode, UpArrow shows the command you recently choosen, not
  the previous one.

- '~' character expansion added

- Directories are kept for filerequester

- Entries in filerequester are labeled

V 1.8

--- 26-Sep-96 ---

- getcwd() used instead of getwd() and help does not crash now.

- Setting of password in phonebook now works OK.

- Problems with multiple printing of some erorr messages fixed (I hope).

- The -m option no longer affects which device will be used :-).

- 'Brightness' parameter added to color menu.

- Colors can be set also for help.

V 1.9

--- 27-Sep-96 ---

- Menu item names are not printed inverted when they are bright. This
  prevents not-very-nice effects.

- Some other 'color' bugs fixed.

- Phonebook brings up so that last entry you dialed is active.

- When sending of a file is paused because of an error, Send Menu
  is made active.

V 1.10

--- 15-Oct-96 ---

- History limit works again.
- Makefile changed to automagically find the ncurses include files.
- lib/mdterm.guide modified - all the links to MD help files replaced
  by the single one.

V 1.11

--- 21-Oct-96 ---

V 1.12

- CR is sent after password instead of LF, so it works also with BC3 systems.
- Personal option file support. All changes are written to it instead of global
  options file. It is read after the global version, so it has greater priority.
- Bright cannot be set in mono mode.
- 'Force mono mode' added to options.

---  7-Nov-96 ---

V 1.13

- PgUp (or CTRL-T) switches to showing buffer and shows previous page
  when in TTY or Buf mode.

--- 14-Nov-96 ---

- Another change from LF to CR to make MDTerm work with BC3.

V 1.14

--- 15-Nov-96 ---

Black hole...

- Only first semicolon on line issues command - rest is ignored.
- Changed printing. Instead of printing to /dev/printer runs lpr.

V 1.18

--- 27-Mar-98 ---

- Dash in arguments now processed correctly

V 1.19

--- 31-Mar-98 --

- Processing command files remade

V 1.20

--- 06-Jun-98 ---

- Changes in processing command filed

V 1.21

--- 21-Jul-98 ---

- GetString() repaired - xmodem send works

V 1.22

--- 17-Sep-98 ---

- Logging enabled by defining LOGFILE symbol. See Makefile.
